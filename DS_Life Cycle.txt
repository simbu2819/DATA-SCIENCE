Str Data Science Life cycle

-- Business understanding 
    - define a business problem - loan permission, churn prediction, telecom next month bill prediction
--- data understanding - do i have the right to the above given problem
                       - source of data, structure of the data
-- exploratory data analysis1
                    - Variable identification - str of variable - type, category, structure
					- Univariate analysis - missing values, outliers, visualize, mct, mds
                    - Bivariate analysis - finding correlation between two variables
-- exploratory data analysis2
                    - Multivariate analysis - t-test, ztest, anova, manova, ancova, mancova
                    - importance of variables - pearson chi square, wald chi square, variable selection methods
                    - normalization of the variables
-- exploratory data analysis3
                   - Feature Engineering 
                            - feature selection(data filtration)
                            - feature extraction (reducing dimensions)
                            - feature construction  (creating new transformed variables - Gender - g_m, g_f)
-- Modelling
            - Regression - prediction of numeric value
            - Classification - Predicting probabilities of a class

-- Model Evaluation
         ROC Curve, confusion matrix, etc.

-- Deployment - expose model as a web service
